## 🌐 Network Policy in Kubernetes


A **Network Policy** in Kubernetes is used to **control communication** between Pods.  

It works like a **firewall inside the cluster**, deciding which Pods can talk to each other and to the outside world.

By default — **all Pods can communicate freely**.  

Once a Network Policy is applied, only the **allowed** traffic is permitted; everything else is **blocked**.

### 🎯 Why We Need It
- To **secure Pod-to-Pod communication**
- To **limit access** between applications
- To **reduce attack surface** inside the cluster

### 🔁 Direction Summary

| **Policy Type** | **Controls Traffic** | **Traffic Direction** | **Common Use Case** |
|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Ingress** | Incoming connections | From → Pod | Allow only frontend → backend traffic |
| **Egress** | Outgoing connections | Pod → Destination | Allow backend → database or external APIs |

### ⚙️ Key Components

| **Component** | **Description** |
|----------------|------------------|
| `podSelector` | Selects the Pods that the policy applies to |
| `policyTypes` | Defines whether the policy controls **Ingress** (incoming) or **Egress** (outgoing) traffic |
| `ingress` | Rules for incoming traffic |
| `egress` | Rules for outgoing traffic |
| `namespaceSelector` | Selects Pods in other namespaces |
| `ipBlock` | Allows or denies traffic from specific IP address ranges |

### Task 1: Check the network connectivity between pods in different namespaces
Create 2 namespaces
```
kubectl create ns devops
```
```
kubectl create ns finance
```
Now label the finance namespace and verify it
```
kubectl label ns finance project=myproject
```
```
kubectl get ns finance --show-labels
```

Create pod in devops namespace
```
kubectl -n devops run ng-pod --image nginx --port 80 --expose
```
Verify the pod and service in the devops namespace
```
kubectl -n devops get all
```
```
kubectl -n devops get po -o wide
```
Create pod in finance namespace
```
kubectl -n finance run pod2 --image centos:8 -- sleep 7000
```
Verify the pod in the finance namespace
```
kubectl -n devops get po
```

Enter the pod in finance namespace  and check its connectivity with a pod in devops namespace
```
kubectl -n finance exec -it pod2 -- bash
```
Curl with the IP address of ng-pod or service of ng-pod
```
 curl <IP of the ng-pod>
```
```
curl <IP of the ng-pod service>
```
```
exit
```
**Note** You can able to curl the ng-pod 

### Task 2: Ingress Network policy with Pod labels 

Create a network policy which uses labels to deny all ingress traffic 
```
vi np-deny-all.yml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  namespace: devops
  name: backend-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      run: ng-pod
  ingress: []
```
```
kubectl apply -f np-deny-all.yml
```
```
kubectl -n devops get networkpolicies
```
```
kubectl -n devops describe networkpolicy backend-policy
```
Now enter into the  pod2 in finance namespace again and verify that it cannot curl the ng-pod from devops namespace

```
kubectl -n finance exec -it pod2 -- bash
```
Curl with the IP address of ng-pod or service of ng-pod
```
 curl <IP of the ng-pod>
```
```
curl <IP of the ng-pod service>
```
It will show timeout
```
exit
```
Modify the network policy to allow traffic with matching namespace labels 
Inspect the network policy and notice the selectors
```
vi np-deny-all.yml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  namespace: devops
  name: backend-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      run: ng-pod
  ingress: 
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          project: myproject  
```
Before applying this yaml describe networkpolicies to check rule
```
kubectl -n devops describe networkpolicy backend-policy
```
```
kubectl apply -f np-deny-all.yml
```
```
kubectl -n devops describe networkpolicies backend-policy
```

Now enter into the  pod2 in finance namespace again and verify that it cannot curl the ng-pod from devops namespace

```
kubectl -n finance exec -it pod2 -- bash
```
Curl with the IP address of ng-pod or service of ng-pod
```
 curl <IP of the ng-pod>
```
```
curl <IP of the ng-pod service>
```
You can able to access
```
exit
```
### Task 3: Egress Policy
Create a pod and check the Egress Rules applied to it by default
```
kubectl run pod1 --image nginx
```
```
kubectl exec -it pod1 -- bash
```
```
curl https://8.8.8.8
```
```
curl https://yahoo.com
```
```
exit
```
Create an Egress Policy
```
vi egress-policy.yaml
```
Create a Kubernetes Network Policy manifest file to define egress rules.
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-outbound
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 8.8.8.8/32  # Example IP address
```
Apply the network policy 
```
kubectl apply -f egress-policy.yaml
```
Verify that the egress policy has been applied to your pods:
```
kubectl get networkpolicies
```
```
kubectl describe networkpolicies
```
Enter the Pod1 and check if the network policy has been applied to it
```
kubectl exec -it pod1 -- bash
```
```
curl https://8.8.8.8
```
It can access the IP as it is enabled by the Egress Policy
```
curl https://yahoo.com
```
It is not able to access other than mentioned in the EgressPolicy

```
exit
```
